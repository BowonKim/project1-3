        <h1>Hi, I'm Bowon!</h1>
        <p>I'm Bowon Kim, a senior at Minnesota State University, Mankato. I am majoring in Computer Information
            Technology and minoring in Graphic Design.</p>
        <br>
        <hr>
        <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
        <p>I grew up in South Korea and I came to the United States to study English and experience other worlds. Since
            I
            was young, I liked to do something with the computer so I decided to major in computer information
            technology
            however during the three years of college, I could not find any fields that want to study more deeply and
            work
            in the specific field. I focused on studying and getting good grades without participating in any activities
            because I didn't know what I want to do.</br></br>
            Then, while taking the graphic design and web design courses last semester, I came across web development
            for
            the first time. While developing the website for the project, it was really interesting that I could see the
            results visually right away. I thought it was a perfect field that combines design and coding that I love
            and I
            could find what I want to do after graduation. After deciding what I want to do, I'm studying to improve my
            skills these days.
        </p>
